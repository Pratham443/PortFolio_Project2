        <h2> Description </h2>
        <p id="hobbyDescription"> I love reading books! I started reading books when I was in 1st grade. I read atleast 1 hour every day then. Whenever I finished all my homework the next thing I did was reading a book. And I was fast with that, I could finish a 150 page book in 2 and half hours! From reading books I became smarter day by day. I basically knew all the concepts that they taught in school. One time a read books for 295 mins in 3rd grade(in a day!!)! That was my record! Now I'm in 4th grade. Now I do Byju's, attend whitehatjr and dance classes and also attend online classes from school. I also have to do Whitehatjr projects and quizzes, school classworks and homeworks. I still get some time though but there are now libraries near my house and if there was there is the pandemic. And I don't like reading from online sources because it increases screen time and also I don't have a habit of reading online as much as reading real books. I have a bookshelf at home though but it has mostly fiction books and I like non-fiction. This now restricts me from reading books, My favorite hobby. </p>
